# RALTS (Really Awesome Lexicon and Tag Suggester)

RALTS (Really Awesome Lexicon and Tag Suggester) is a script that can analyse any body of text or URL to find extract keywords, topics, and categories using NLP (natural language processing) via the TextRazor API and a BART language model.

I've written a full-length blog post about the script and why I made it, which you can [read on my personal website](https://lukealexdavis.co.uk/post/introducing-ralts/).
